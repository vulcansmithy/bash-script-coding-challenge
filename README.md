## Bash Script Coding Challenge

### Instruction

Go to [https://github.com/vulcansmithy/bash-script-coding-challenge](https://github.com/vulcansmithy/bash-script-coding-challenge), and **git fork** the repo. Once you cloned the repo you need to create a Bash script that would do the following:

- Go to the folder called **unsanitized** copy the images found on the said folder to the another folder called **sanitized**
- Once copied to the **sanitized** folder, renamed the copied file by appending the word **-sanitized** to the filename.  For example, the original fileaname is **sample-24.jpg**. Rename it to **sample-24-sanitized.jpg**
- Assume the folder **unsanitized** contained 1 to x-number of images
- Once done, append to the README file a step-by-step instruction on how execute the bash script that you wrote
- Periodically, commit your changes to the repo. We want to see the progression of you coding in the git logs

### How to submit

- Provide us the link of the finished coding excercise by providing the url of the forked repo
